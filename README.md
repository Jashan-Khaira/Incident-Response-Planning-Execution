### 1. Introduction:
Incident Response Planning and Execution is crucial for any organization to effectively detect, respond to, and mitigate security incidents. This virtual lab provides hands-on experience in developing incident response plans, simulating security incidents, and executing incident response procedures within a controlled environment.

### 2. Lab Setup:
#### 2.1 Host Operating System:
- Install Ubuntu Server (or any other Linux distribution) as the host operating system.

#### 2.2 Virtualization Software:
- Install VirtualBox or VMware Workstation on the host operating system.

#### 2.3 Virtual Machines:
- **Kali Linux**: Download the Kali Linux ISO image from the official website and create a new virtual machine.
- **Windows Server 2016/2019**: Install Windows Server on a new virtual machine to simulate the target environment.
- **Ubuntu Server (or CentOS)**: Deploy Ubuntu Server (or CentOS) as the SIEM server to manage logs and events.

#### 2.4 Networking:
- Create a virtual network within the virtualization software to connect all virtual machines.
- Assign static IP addresses to each virtual machine to ensure consistent connectivity.
- Configure routing and connectivity between Kali Linux, Windows Server, and the SIEM server.

### 3. Lab Exercises:
#### 3.1 Incident Response Plan Development:
- Research and draft an incident response plan tailored to the simulated environment's needs, including procedures for incident identification, containment, eradication, and recovery.
- Define roles and responsibilities for incident response team members.
- Determine escalation procedures and communication channels for reporting and responding to incidents.

#### 3.2 Scenario Simulation:
- Simulate various security incidents such as malware infections, data breaches, phishing attacks, and insider threats within the controlled environment.
- Use Kali Linux to launch simulated attacks against the Windows Server, exploiting vulnerabilities and compromising system integrity.

#### 3.3 Incident Detection and Analysis:
- Configure logging and monitoring on the Windows Server to capture security events and anomalies.
- Set up log forwarding to the SIEM server for centralized log management and analysis.
- Monitor the SIEM dashboard for alerts and anomalies indicative of a security incident.

#### 3.4 Incident Response Execution:
- Upon detection of a security incident, follow the predefined incident response plan to contain and mitigate the threat.
- Isolate compromised systems, conduct forensics analysis, and identify the root cause of the incident.
- Implement remediation measures to eradicate the threat and restore affected systems to a secure state.

#### 3.5 Post-Incident Review:
- Conduct a post-incident review to assess the effectiveness of the incident response plan and identify areas for improvement.
- Document lessons learned and update the incident response plan accordingly to enhance preparedness for future incidents.

### 4. Conclusion:
This manual provides a comprehensive overview of setting up and conducting the Incident Response Planning and Execution virtual lab. By actively engaging in simulated scenarios and exercises, participants can develop practical skills in incident response planning, detection, analysis, and execution, contributing to the enhancement of their organization's cybersecurity posture.
